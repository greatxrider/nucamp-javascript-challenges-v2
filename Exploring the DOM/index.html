<h1 id="title">Exploring the DOM</h1>

<!-- intro section -->
<section>
    <p>Today's lessons have focused on three essential aspects of working with
        the DOM in web development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DOM Basic Concepts:</strong> Understanding what the DOM is,
            how HTML is represented in the DOM, and the significance of text
            nodes and whitespace nodes.</li>
        <li><strong>Node Relationships:</strong> Learning how nodes in the DOM
            tree are related to each other, including parent-child and sibling
            relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Locating Nodes:</strong> Practicing how to find specific
            nodes in the DOM using various methods, such as by ID or class
            name.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This interactive exercise will allow you to apply these concepts in a
        hands-on manner. Follow the instructions in each section, and look at
        the code to predict and understand how the DOM is manipulated. Let's get
        started!</p>

    <!-- node relationships section -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="sub-title">Node Relationships</h2>
        <p>1. Explore how nodes are related in the DOM tree. Before clicking the
            buttons below, look at the code. Find the function that is called by
            each button's click. Read the code and try to guess which nodes will
            be affected when highlighting the parent, children, and sibling
            nodes of this section. Then click on the button to see if you are
            correct.</p>
        <button onclick="highlightParent()">Highlight Parent</button>
        <button onclick="highlightChildren()">Highlight Children</button>
        <button onclick="highlightSibling()">Highlight Sibling</button>
        <div class="input-row">
            <label for="element-input">2. What is the parent element of this
                "Node Relationships" section?</label>
            <input type="text" id="element-input" placeholder="Enter tag name (e.g., 'div')">
            <button onclick="checkElement()">Check Answer</button>
            <p id="feedback"></p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <!-- locating nodes section -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="sub-title">Locating Nodes</h2>
        <p>1. Practice finding nodes using different methods. Before clicking
            the buttons below, look at the code. Find the function that is
            called by each button's click. Read the code and try to guess which
            elements will be targeted in that function, and what will happen
            when you click on the button. After you predict their behaviors,
            click on each button to see if you are correct.</p>
        <button onclick="findById()">Find by ID</button>
        <button onclick="findByClass()">Find by Class</button>
        <button onclick="findByTagName()">Find by Tag Name</button>
        <button onclick="findByQuerySelector()">Find by Query Selector</button>
        <p>2. Next, reflect on the actions performed by the buttons, and modify
            the functions to create your own manipulations. Try to make
            different things happen with each button. Then click on the buttons
            to test your changes.</p>
