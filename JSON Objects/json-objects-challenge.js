  /* This line below is fetching data from a website API. You haven't learned how to do this just yet, so here's a short explanation of what it does:
  - 'fetch' is the function that sends a query to the website url, in this case this website https://www.superheroapi.com.
  - 'await' tells JavaScript that the answer won't come back immediately and it needs to wait for it.
  - 'then' tells JavaScript what to do with the website answer when it comes back
  - 'response' is what the website sends back. We then use the text() function to get the text result. Note that the json() function would return a well formed JSON JavaScript Object.
