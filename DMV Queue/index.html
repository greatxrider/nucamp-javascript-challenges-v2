    <h2>Scenario:</h2>
    <p>Your local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office wants to manage their waiting customers more efficiently.
        They
        need a system to handle a queue of customers, where they can add a customer to the queue, call the next customer
        to
        the counter, and display the list of people currently waiting in the queue.</p>

    <p>An employee has dabbled in some HTML and basic programming, and created a simple UI for this new queue system,
        but
        they need your help to complete the functions and make the queue system work.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Tasks:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, fork this pen to save your changes.</li>
        <li>Complete the <strong>addCustomer()</strong> function by using a push method to add the <strong>name</strong>
            variable to the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array.</li>
        <li>Complete the <strong>callNextCustomer()</strong> function by using the shift method to remove the first
            person
            from the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array. Assign this method to a new variable called
            <strong>nextCustomer</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Complete the <strong>displayQueue()</strong> function by creating an alert message that uses the join method
            to
            display the list of elements in the <strong>dmvQueue</strong> array.</li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <h2>Check your code:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the "Add Customer" button a few times and enter some customer names.</li>
        <li>Click the "Call Next Customer" button to remove a customer from the front of the queue.</li>
        <li>Click the "Display Queue" button to see the current queue.</li>
    </ol>
